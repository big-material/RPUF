# RPUF: Predicted AD TC and CS

It was used to predict the apparent density (AD), thermal conductivity (TC) and compressive strength (CS) of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF)

### Main Features

-  Feature engineering (calculating foam gas production, etc.)
-  Regression and classification models for performance prediction and type differentiation
-  SHAP analysis and correlation analysis
-  Streamlit visualization interface

## Usage

### 1. Launch Streamlit visualization interface
```bash
streamlit run runner.py
```

# Reference

Predict the density, thermal conductivity and compressive strength of rigid polyurethane foams. submit.
